              Paris
              It is always very <span>difficult</span> to talk about things that are dear to me; Even the most beautiful words seem banal to me,
              and empty of meaning. Sometimes, quite simply, I can not find words to describe something, because what can really
              speak
              is the heart. It is the same with my trip to Paris. When someone asks me to tell Paris, with eyes almost filled with
              tears and with great emotion, I begin to tell. But no word can describe what the eyes see.
            
              I think I am a lucky one because I had the <span>opportunity</span> to see my dream realized. I always wanted to visit Paris, walk
              the streets, admire the architectural beauties, meet new people, see other mentalities, listen to the music that I was
              imbued in school. I remember I was singing the songs of Patricia Kaas, Lara Fabian, Dalida, Mireille Mathieu. French
              music has always brought me closer to France. As a naive child, I dreamed all my life of going to France and rarely
              thought that this dream could materialize.
              I heard stories about the city, I saw movies on Paris, I listened to songs about the city of light, the city of love,
              the city of the Eiffel Tower, I saw images. I knew all that, I knew where Paris was, I knew what I could see, I knew
              how
              to do it, I knew the names of the streets and places; But what a difference with all that I knew; Nothing could
              compare
              with reality.
            
              I arrived in Paris one fine day of spring 2010, a day that will be printed forever in my heart. After a year, I try to
              recollect the pieces of my memories. It was the most beautiful spring of my life.
              The city covers us with its energy, and we do not know where this positive energy comes from: people who pass from
              heaven to works of art; But it is a fact that one senses all these things. I enjoy every day lived in Paris: every
              morning when I woke up, each coffee drunk with a cake from the bakery, each person smiling at me, every moment.
              For everyone, Paris is unique, different. Simply, I fell in love. And again it's spring, and I dream of you, Paris!
